# Python_Biology
This repository contains several programs I made for BSC2891: Python Programming for Biologists. Here is what each does:

hw.py : Prints 'hello world' to the screen

testcla.py : Multiplies the given number by 10

forloop.py : Prints 1 through the given positive number and ends with 'Done!'

log.py: Calculates the lof of each of the given numbers

add2.py: Adds the two given numbers

norm.py: Creates a list of 'simulated counts' starting at 0 and ending at the given number, then prints the resulting frequency distribution; ex: if you input '3', you will get [0, .33333, .66666]

listcomp.py : Prints the given numbers divded by 2 to the next lowest integer

translate.py : Translates the given cDNA sequence into an amino acid sequence

read.py : Prints the given text file, line by line

write.py : Creates a text file with the given file name, containing 1 through 5, each number on a separate line

agl.py : Finds the average and standard deviation of lengths of the given feature for a General Feature Format (GFF) file; uses a specific file path in the code

model.py : Builds a structural homology model of a protein's 3D structure with given alignment filename, template ID, target sequence ID, and atom files directory
